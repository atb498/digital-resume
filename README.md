#  About Me:
My name is Austin Busby, a computer engineering student at Missisippi State. I am a computer nerd who loves to learn about the interworkings of all things computer-related and hope to achieve a great position within this amazing field. My hobbies include playing casual sports, playing video games, barbequeing, and hiking.
